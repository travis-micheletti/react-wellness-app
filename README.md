## What and Why?
  - I wanted to make an application that I would actually use for the foreseeable future. I wanted something that was geared towards things that were important to me or things I loved doing. I love laughing, learning, eating, and the Lofi Girl youtube channel!
  - I wanted to accomplish this while also showcasing what I've learned in class the last few weeks.
  - I decided to hit on several topics with this app, but originally had wanted to focus on something for healthy recipes/cooking.
  - After some thought I wanted to expand and have further elements to the page that would be immediately satisfying but I could also work on over time tos how my growth as a developer.
  - With these, I made separate components for navigating around the app but also for the main content: food, jokes, facts, and music

## Contribution Guidelines
- If you have suggestions or if something is bothering you about the app and you want it to change, feel free to submit issue requests via GitHub
- If you're working on the app and have code you feel is worthy of merging:
    - Create a pull request from your forked repo to main repo
    - With your forked request, please include detailed comments as to what changes you made, why, and screenshots showing the changes being implemented
   
## Unresolved Problems
- As of right now there are a few bugs where if the buttons are clicked too quicly or icons hovered over too often that the transition effects don't occur 100% of the time, unsure how to fix
- Sometimes my APIs are pulling bad/incomplete pieces of data. Sometimes it's a missing picture or link but it makes for a not great experience sometimes. Ideally this would be fixed in the future

## Future Goals
- I want to continue developing this as a personal tool I can use moving forward. There's a lot I can think of stylistically I can change but my first goal would be to make the app more useful by way of a few different implementations/changes:
    - First I'd like to increase the number of sources I'm currently pulling jokes and facts from. I would genuinely like to use this as a way to learn something or hear a joke I don't hear often, and as of right now the results are a bit limited due to the APIs I'm using
    - I'd also like to expand heavily upon the recipe searcher section. I'd like to be able to filter out different foods based on ingrediets, meal type, diet type, etc
    - I'd like to add additional music sources/live streams onto the music page to make all of my go-to's readily accessible on one page. A longer term goal is to eventually be able to minimize the youtube stream throughout my app so that music won't be interrupted after navigating away
- After the different content tweeks, I would like to reorganize all of my styled components so that I'm not repeating myself so much. I feel there's a lot of room to make the code more DRY and it will assist with my understanding of the 'styled-components' library overall

## Final Thoughts
    I had a lot of fun making this project! There are certainly things I would do differently in the future but all-in-all I'm walking away from this feeling more comfortable with React as a whole but also excited to continue my learning experience with not only React but the entire Frontend ecosystem. I for sure could have saved myself some time and probably struggle by using a different library and becoming more familiar with it (thinking of something like Bootstrap) but I walk away feeling proud of the work I did and the troubleshooting/problem-solving I was able to accomplish along the way. Really looking forward to continuing this project moving forward!
