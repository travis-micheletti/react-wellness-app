## Live App Pictures


## What and Why?
  - I wanted to make an application that I would actually use for the foreseeable future. I wanted something that was geared towards things that were important to me or things I loved doing. I love laughing, learning, eating, and the Lofi Girl youtube channel!
  - I wanted to accomplish this while also showcasing what I've learned in class the last few weeks.
  - I decided to hit on several topics with this app, but originally had wanted to focus on something for healthy recipes/cooking.
  - After some thought I wanted to expand and have further elements to the page that would be immediately satisfying but I could also work on over time tos how my growth as a developer.
  - With these, I made separate components for navigating around the app but also for the main content: food, jokes, facts, and music
